The source code of our manuscript submitted to Pattern Recognition: 
'Low-Rank Analysis Guided Adaptive Learning for Video Saliency Detection'

Requirement:
1.Visual Studio 2010 x86 enviroument
2.CUDA v6.5+
3.Matlab 2012a
4.Video sequences should be added to the '.\sequences\' directory accordingly.

The default installation path of CUDA is: "C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v6.5\lib\x64\",
and the default installation path of VisualStudio is: "E:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\bin".
The readers should change the CUDA path and VisualStudio path in '.\cuda\compile.m' file accordingly.

Also, the matlab path of '.\cuda\*.cu' files should also be changed accordingly
(e.g., the default matlab path is "E:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2012b\extern\include\mex.h").
